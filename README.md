SignToolEx uses Microsoft Detours hooking library to hijack "signtool.exe" and modify
expired code-signing certificates to appear valid, allowing to codesign without changing
system clock. This allows expired (leaked) certificates to be used for code-signing but
does not permit spoofing Authenticode timestamps. Some versions of Windows (such as 10)
accept and load .sys device drivers when signed with expired certificates regardless. 

This tool is used in the same way as "signtool.exe" by simply running "SignToolEx.exe",
needs SignToolExHook.dll in the current directory and "signtool.exe" in your %PATH%.
